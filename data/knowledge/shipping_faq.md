## Can I pick up my order at your offices?
Most certainly! We’d love to have a chat with you and offer you a coffee. Please reach out to us before you place your order, using the "Contact us" form on the bottom of this page. You can visit us Monday through Friday during office hours. If you would like to come and check out our collections, please call us ahead to make an appointment.

## What happens if I’m not home when my shipment arrives?
In Switzerland: the mail man will leave a collection slip in your mailbox, which you can use to pick up your package at your local post office the next day.

International: all orders are delivered upon signature by DHL Express. As soon as your order is shipped, you will receive a confirmation email with a tracking link. DHL On-Demand Delivery allows you to modify certain shipping preferences. For example, you may choose to have your package left with a neighbor if they know you aren't going to be in. Please note that choosing a DHL pick-up location is unfortunately not possible.
