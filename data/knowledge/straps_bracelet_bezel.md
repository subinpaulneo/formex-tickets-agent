## Can I adjust the strap size myself?
Yes. 

When you order a watch on a strap or a stainless steel bracelet, we always ask you to provide your wrist size (what's my wrist size?). This way, we can pre-size the strap or bracelet for you, allowing you to try on the watch right out of the box. Please be aware that adjusting the length yourself would void eligibility for a free return and full refund.

Stainless steel bracelets can be shortened or lengthened with the Formex screwdriver provided in the box. If you need extra links, they are available online: https://formexwatch.com/collections/accessories/?_bc_fsnf=1&FILTER=STRAPS

Do not hesitate to watch our instructions videos to see how to adjust your bracelet: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDUVWldy2JeegTbVfU7rLbOk36RgmUYx&si=7H_orSKxt1CdE8cU 

## Can I change a Formex strap by myself?
Yes, all our watches are equipped with either a custom quick-release system or conventional quick-release spring bars, which you can change on your own without the use of any tools.

## Do all straps and bracelets in the online store fit all watch models?
No. To find the strap that fits your Formex watch, go to Accessories and select your model in the filters.
