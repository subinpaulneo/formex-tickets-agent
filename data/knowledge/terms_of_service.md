Refusal to provide those is not a valid reason for a refund and a refund will only be issued after the customer has received and shipped back the watch.

**Warranty, service and repairs** 

16\. Our watches are covered by a warranty of three years against mechanical and manufacturing defects. The warranty period starts from date stated in the owner’s manual. 

17\. Mechanical watches are precision mechanical instruments. Excessive shocks or vibrations, exposure to strong electromagnetic fields and similar activities can cause damage to or affect their functionality. The mechanical warranty does not cover issues or malfunctions caused by mishandling. 

18\. Accessories that are affected by normal wear and tear due to regular use are exempt from the three-year warranty. This includes typical signs of wear such as scratches, abrasion, or discoloration that may occur through usage. The warranty exclusively covers mechanical and manufacturer-related defects. 

19\. Watches and accessories are _not_ user serviceable. We cannot guarantee water resistance or mechanical function of the watch if the watch case has been opened or serviced by the customer or a third party not approved by Formex. Doing so will void all warranties. 

20\. We do not supply spare parts or components. 

21\. Repairs can take up to eight weeks. As soon as the watch is ready to ship, we will send an e-mail. 

22\. Wear and tear (e.g. water damage to straps, scuff marks and scratches to the case or clasp, etc.) are not covered by the warranty. This extends to any external coatings or treatments, such as DLC coating, heat bluing or AR coating, to the watch case, crown, crystal and buckle. 

23\. For a warranty claim, we reserve the right to replace the watch or relevant components with ones of equivalent, or greater value in the event parts are no longer available. 

24\. In case of a warranty claim or service request, please email us through our [contact form](https://formexwatch.com/pages/contact/). 

25\. For warranty work, we will arrange for a prepaid return label at our cost. 

26\. For out-of-warranty service, both legs of shipping are at the owner’s cost. 

27\. For watch services or repairs outside warranty coverage, Formex will furnish a cost estimate for the repair after the watch has been sent in for inspection and analyzed by our watchmakers. The work will be charged depending on scope. Payment for the repair must be made in full before the watch is returned to the owner.  

26.1 In the case of a watch service where the cost estimate is rejected or cannot be carried out due to unavailability of spare parts, or for an assessment that does not reveal any warranty-covered issues, customers may be subject to a handling fee, shipping charges, and any relevant taxes and customs fees. Formex reserves the right to retain the watch until payment is received.

28\. If you would like to send your watch for a repair, please send us the following information by email to [support@formexwatch.com](mailto:support@formexwatch.com) :  

*   a picture of the warranty card of your watch
*   a video or a picture of the issue
*   your shipping address and phone number

Having all these information allows us to decide on how we proceed to find the best solution for you.  

29\. While we will try our best to make repairs and return a watch to proper working condition, it is sometimes not economically viable or possible to repair a watch if the damage is too extensive. 

**Returns & refunds**

31\. Watches can be tried on but not worn. Protections, if any, cannot be taken off. 

32\. The customer is responsible to try on the watch without leaving any scratches or marks on the watch or any part thereof. If a watch is returned and signs of wear and tear mentioned above are found at inspection, the watch will be sent back to the customer and no refund is issued. 

33\. All accessories are consumables and are not eligible for free returns. If you opt to return your accessories order, kindly be informed that you will bear the responsibility for the return shipping expenses.

We will provide you with a pre-paid shipping label for your convenience. Please note that the shipping costs incurred during the initial shipment and the return shipment, along with any applicable taxes and duties, will be deducted from your refund amount. 

34\. If you opt to return accessories separately from your watch order, kindly be informed that you will bear the responsibility for the return shipping expenses.

35\. After verifying that the item has not been used and does not show any signs of wear, we will issue a refund for the item minus shipping fees that were charged at checkout. If shipping was included in your order, the shipping rate deducted will be the rate charged to Formex by the carrier.  

36\. If watches are returned for the purpose of replacing the same order, but to change order modalities, such as payment method or similar, shipping cost will be deducted from the refund.

37\. In the event of rejected shipments, the refund will be subject to deductions for shipping costs, as well as any applicable taxes and duties.

40\. For watch returns within the 30-days period and for watches under warranty Formex will provide the buyer with a prepaid return label and arrange for insurance during transit. 

41\. If a buyer chooses to arrange their own return shipping, responsibility of the watch during transit is the buyer's responsibility. 

42\. The watch must be packaged in a similar fashion that it has arrived in , in order not to be damaged during transport. 

43\. Refunds, where applicable, will be processed by us within 7 working days - though clearance of funds on is dependent on the recipient bank/card issuer and may be longer. 

44\. Should the watch be in a used condition or incomplete, we will contact you to have the watch shipped back to you. Shipping will be charged. In some cases, it is possible to issue a partial refund. 

45\. Formex will refund you within 14 working days upon receipt of the returned good(s) using the same means of payment used for purchase.
