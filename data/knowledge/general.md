*Who's behind Formex?*
Formex Watch SA is an independent watch manufacturer based in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland. The enthusiast-based brand was founded in 1998 by two Swiss brothers, both watchmakers and enthusiasts alike. They wanted to combine their passion for watches with their love for motorsports and are the inventors of the patented Case Suspension System. 

In 2016, the company was taken over by Raphaël Granito, a young entrepreneur from Biel/Bienne, who changed the business model and transitioned the brand into the digital age. Raphaël combines his family's expertise in the manufacturing of watch components with his thrive of breaking boundaries, taking risks and testing limits.
