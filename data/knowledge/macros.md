## Accuracy - keep observing

**Title:** Add response text

**Body:**
Dear {{ticket.customer.firstname}} 

Thank you for reaching out to us. 

Firstly, we would like to assure you that slight variations in timekeeping are not uncommon in mechanical watches and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including movement and wear. The Formex 39 is designed to maintain precise timekeeping, and we are here to help address any concerns you may have.

It's worth noting that the movement in your Essence 39mm is COSC certified and should be accurate to within -4 to +6 seconds per day. These values represent mean values, which were measured over a period of 14 days and small fluctuations within this range are generally considered acceptable.

Given your observation, we would recommend you keep observing the accuracy of your watch over the next 14 days. If you continue to notice a consistent gain in time, kindly reach out to us again with your findings. This information will help us better assess the situation and provide you with appropriate guidance.

Thank you for your cooperation and best regards,

## Bezel misalignment tolerance

**Title:** Add response text

**Body:**
Hello {{ticket.customer.firstname}},

The bezel alignment is checked during the final inspection at our factory. Offsets of more than 0.25mm do not leave our premises. In general, tolerances in the trim are +/-0.03mm per rib. The alignment of a bezel with the dial depends on 8 components and about 12 ribs. If all components are at maximum tolerance, that's 0.36mm of accumulated tolerance.

For perfect alignment of all components by tightening tolerances to micron values, the same watch would cost at least 7x as much.

Aligning rotating bezels is particularly difficult, as a quick Google search will show : https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a83470496b33a403&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCH724CH724&sxsrf=ADLYWIKz-5v3RutF2ZkV-HLBJGJr85Eyqg:1716472397469&q=rolex+misalignment+bezel&uds=ADvngMjlM2UpPr9WtJJUwGjC4m3KgT_KDZzDIUMqS53glOX8bMrVbw641A3fYmrQ8rQELMNNUB2mEtmWPOfzNTl9x1Lnzvmx4xTMc6MFJ7a2Rz3KsZWfe8DaJ03mynxcsBFCtPpx9UWXgT6XCun0tzaoGUls6meJrM7I-3sVOrMkyqcZENSwUEl9mZI5dRF3YUcLjfHPbbrCRlrcgf0D8rpZAoWbGCY4nr5BCcfaLFT0I5oPzt6uYlBymmzkpiAgTGPMSQjP8CCT7ZN7_ov9Z4AqVnhOJ5Y3-rogzSWCYK_EVgrUIYBf5BRGP4hVb4-Iwm_grBBsg2HCzjn5HGAGY43ZNGd34qAK0Q&udm=2&prmd=ivnmbtz&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg6pH89aOGAxXvh_0HHX21Bh8QtKgLegQICxAB&biw=1667&bih=892&dpr=2#vhid=QUyx8nqRl8sc5M&vssid=mosaic

I hope this helps to understand the slight misalignment on your model.

## Is the bezel will fall off ?

**Title:** Add response text

**Body:**
Hi{{ticket.customer.firstname}},

The inspiration for our exchangeable bezels came directly from our customer's valuable feedback. 
Initially absent in the first Reef version, we quickly realized the demand for customization on our Online Store. Our customers found themselves grappling with the multitude of combinations of bezels, straps, and dials. 

As a solution, we introduced exchangeable bezels. These complement our patented quick-release bracelets and straps, seamlessly clicking onto the watch case with a wire spring installed inside the bezel. This design ensures a secure fit, preventing accidental detachment, yet remains effortlessly removable by hand, with just the right amount of force and angle at 12 or 6 o’clock.

Feel free to reach out anytime if you have further questions.

Best,

{{current_user.firstname}}

## Retailer Request

**Title:** Add response text

**Body:**
Thank you for your interest in Formex. Would it be possible to share a website of your store and some pictures and the location on a map?

We are not currently represented in Kosovo and a collaboration could be possible. 

Since Formex was relaunched in 2018 as a direct to consumer brand our wholesale margins are a bit lower than traditionally distributed brands. We can offer a wholesale discount of 35% on the net prices and we require payment in CHF. Our initial order should be above 20k CHF and for the first order we need prepayment. Any following order benefits from 30 net payment terms. 

Please let me know if this could be a viable option for you. 

Best regards,
Raphael Granito

## Cost estimate - example for a high cost

**Title:** Add response text

**Body:**
Dear {{ticket.customer.firstname}},

We have thoroughly assessed your timepiece and are writing to provide you with a cost estimate for the necessary repairs and replacements.
After careful examination, we have determined that the following services are required to ensure your timepiece's optimal performance and appearance:

Revision of the movement: The movement of your timepiece needs a comprehensive revision. Our skilled technicians will meticulously examine the movement, ensuring that any glass splinters or debris are completely removed. This process is crucial to guarantee the smooth operation and longevity of your watch.
Replacement of the dial: Unfortunately, the dial has been damaged due to the impact caused by the glass splitter. To restore the aesthetics of your timepiece, we recommend replacing the dial entirely with a new one.
Replacement of the Crystal: The crystal of your timepiece also needs to be replaced. This is necessary to ensure the clear visibility of the dial and to provide proper protection for the movement. 

To proceed with the required repairs, we would like to provide you with the following cost breakdown:

Movement revision: 160 USD 
Change of sapphire crystal: 65 USD
Change of dial: 250 USD
Shipping: 45 USD 
Total: 520 USD

We will send you a PayPal payment request shortly. Once we receive the payment, we will begin the repair process and let you know as soon as your watch is ready to ship. Should you not approve the estimate, kindly let us know by replying to this email.

Please note that prices mentioned are exclusive of duties and taxes. Additional duties and taxes, if applicable, are the recipient's responsibility and may vary based on location and local regulations.

If you have any further questions or concerns regarding the estimate or the repair procedure, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to assist you and ensure that your watch receives the attention it deserves.

Regarding your return request, our Terms & Conditions specify that returns can only be accepted for watches that are unworn and show no signs of wear. Even within a day, the steel bezel and bracelet may develop micro-scratches, which means the watch may no longer qualify for return.

## Ceramic - what if it breaks?

**Title:** Add response text

**Body:**
Hello,

Thank you for reaching us,

Firstly, we would like to highlight that ceramic is a strong and wear-resistant material, which is why it is commonly used in high-end watch cases where both strength and scratch resistance are crucial. However, like any watch, it is important to handle it with care to avoid sudden impacts or drops.

Your Formex is covered by a three-year warranty. If the issue falls within the warranty terms, shipping and service costs will be covered. Please note, however, that if the problem is due to magnetization, shock, improper use, or neglect, the warranty may not apply, and service and shipping charges will be incurred. Rest assured, we do have spare parts available for any necessary repairs.

Thank you and best regards,

We kindly ask you to pack the watch well, so that it is not damaged during the transport. Please also enclose the certificate, the owner’s manual, your name, shipping address and phone number.

Make sure you label your shipment as a "Watch repair" or "Watch service", so no taxes and duties are charged. We can’t accept a shipment that is not declared correctly, as we would wrongfully incur taxes and duties.
Please note that depending on the country you ship from, you will be charged taxes and duties when receiving your watch back. You may request a reimbursement at your country's custom office. For this, you usually will need to provide the tracking number for both shipments - we recommend keeping them at hand.

We will furnish a cost estimate for the repair after the watch has been sent in for inspection. Should you not authorize Formex to undertake the repair, the watch will be shipped back at your cost.
