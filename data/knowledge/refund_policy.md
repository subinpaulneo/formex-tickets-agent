Return & Refund Policy

# Refund Policy - Official FORMEX Watches®
  

**Returns**   
Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange. 

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. Discounted items and gift cards cannot be returned. 

To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase. 

There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted (if applicable)   
\- Watches or Accessories with obvious signs of use   
\- Any item not in its original condition, is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error   
\- Any item that is returned more than 30 days after delivery 

\- If watches are returned for the purpose of replacing the same order, but to change order modalities, shipping cost will be deducted from the refund.

\- Only watches are subject to free returns. All accessories and parts have to be returned at the customers cost. 

**Refunds (if applicable)**   
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.   
If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days. 

**Late or missing refunds (if applicable)**   
If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.   
Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.   
Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.   
If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at info@formexwatch.com. 

**Sale items (if applicable)**   
Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded. 

**Exchanges (if applicable)**   
We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at info@formexwatch.com and send your item to: Formex Watch SA, Wasserstrasse 42, 2500 Biel, Switzerland. 

**Gifts**   
If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you. 

If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return. 

**Shipping**   
Please notify us at info@formexwatch.com about your refund request before returning the items. We will send you a return label free of charge. This applies to all watch purchases. Accessories and non-watch items have to be returned at your own cost and the shipping charge will not be refunded. If your returned items turn out not to be eligible for refund, we will charge you for the return label. 

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary. 

If you decide to ship the items with your own shipping provider and the value of the items is over CHF 75.-, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
